        <p>For my first visit to UMass Amherst’s Museum of Contemporary Art, I viewed the exhibition of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot, a Paris based artist, who marries sound and sculpture into an emotional environment. The material and its auditory capabilities feel as though they are acting alone, without any human direction. The somber and dense architecture of UMCA was an appropriate aesthetic environment. It’s immense concrete walls felt like an absorbing void after an apocalypse, emphasizing the objects and mechanisms left behind. Despite the apparent lack of human imposition, each work was displayed with precision and tasteful sparsity.</p>

        <p>My initial reaction to the room was an eerie sense of calm, as though setting the stage to be hypnotized. This feeling came from the quiet and dimly lit projections that pulsated and transformed throughout the space. These glowing abstract orbs, titled <em>viruses</em>, and accompanying silk screened images taken from stills of the projection, established the mood. The row of monochromatic silkscreens are made up of layers of ink that slowly reveal the <em>virus</em> image. Bringing the pulsating <em>virus</em> into a low tech translation, a series of 2D prints, embodies the notion that an idea can be expressed through many different languages.</p>

                <p>After the initiation into the room with <em>viruses</em>, I was immediately drawn to the quiet teleprompter in the back. An oddly beautiful object in its simplicity and function, transports information revealing seemingly random numbers and letters on it’s screen. As you investigate further, you realize that the text is stock market data being fed via the internet that is then processed through software that transforms the text into a musical score. This score is then heard through a self playing piano in the next room. I found the separation of the two counterparts, the teleprompter and the piano, to be an interesting installation choice, for I did not make the connection immediately. Together they are titled <em>indexes</em>. This disconnect is a recurring installation theme throughout the exhibit. The origin of the information/sound is directly made from what is visual, but the context has been shifted slightly and therefore both revealed and hidden at the same time.</p>

            <div class="column-right">
                <p><em>zombiedrone</em>, an installation made up of a plasma screen tv, a black leather couch and a remote control, caught my eye next. The tv played a dark and distorted movie which gave off a sinister vibe when combined with the black masculine couch. It would not be a stretch for ones imagination to trick you into thinking you were viewing a scene from <em>Alien</em>. As I started to decipher the image I noticed it was more benign. In fact, the tv was broadcasting everyday television programing. <em>zombiedrone</em> uses the scenario of processing information through a predetermined set of rules. Here the unmoving images are blacked out. The viewer also has the ability to change the channel at will and try to make sense of the partially hidden screen. Unlike <em>indexes</em>, I felt that this was overtly trying to be macabre instead of a quite investigation of material. The dramatic masculine materials led me to dramatic and masculine notions. Having the viewer be an active translator made this installation successful in its subtlety.  </p>
                <p>On the more quiet end of the exhibit we see, <em>flameByframe</em>, a somewhat hidden ghostly apparition. It is only really noticeable after viewing <em>zombidrome</em> or when you turn to leave. The projection is a video of a blowtorch flame in slow motion. As the video camera was filming, it was taking the image and translating that information into audio. The audio was played through a subwoofer that altered the movement of the flame. This created a circle of image information effecting sound information and vise versa, until the flame eventually blows itself out. In the final display, Celeste only shows the video of the flame slowly dancing in complete silence. Beautiful by itself, the knowledge of the chaotic scenario that produced <em>flameByframe</em> was not directly apparent. </p>

        <p>The written information is part of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot work but I appreciate its discreteness in not being a visual aspect of the show. This is an exhibition to be absorbed and experienced. There doesn't seem to be a direct meaning except what the material is and what it can sound like. Information shown, information dissolved and information transformed. One thing leading to the next and the next and the next until even the links become irrelevant. The link becomes less important as the idea of animism became more important. What you see and what you hear and how that translates to you is entirely subjective but the objects themselves are neutral in terms of the laws imposed on them by Celeste Boursier-Mougenot. They do what they do.</p>
