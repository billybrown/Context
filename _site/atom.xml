            &lt;h1&gt;Loveland&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Short Story inspired by Charles Stankievech’s 'Loveland' Installation at Mass MoCA’s Oh Canada exhibition&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By Jessie Vogel&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; It is 1979 and Troy Baker is 40 years old. In 1952, Troy Baker was 13 years old and read &lt;em&gt;The Purple Cloud&lt;/em&gt; written in 1901 by M. P. Shiel. Troy Baker is the third child of Bob and Tina Baker. At 13 Troy Baker was significantly closer to his older sister, Susan Baker, than he was to the “middle child” Baker. Home was situated on lands that were tropical and vibrant and fruitful but in one respect a loveless land. Many strands of Bakers, not just those of Bob and Tina Baker, inhabited this loveless land. The most destructive feuds over property are, of course, family feuds. It was a loveless land, except for a brother who loves a sister and a sister who loves something else.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;middle-full-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/loveland/loveland_5.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/loveland/loveland_3.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/loveland/loveland_6.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Do all Homeo Sapiens have a natural compulsion to love gemstones? Susan Baker did. She had 160 stones that were precious and gems. Compulsion to collect objects is to maintain control and has the convenient tendency to minimize human interaction. As it happens, the same year Troy Baker read &lt;em&gt;The Purple Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, Susan Baker also died. Troy Baker has Susan Baker’s ultraviolet emerald that he took out of her room in 1951. Death is a transfer of energy. Troy Baker is not a collector. He both hates and cherishes the ultraviolet emerald.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 1979, Troy Baker is 40 years old and on a Canadian research submarine surrounded by the deep waters of the Arctic. Ice blue, then blinding white, as they reemerge through the frozen surface. The shell cracking was rude and very satisfying. Troy followed one man out. It was the color of Italian ice, the color of a stadium bulb, the color of punches to the head. It was loud and unlike many on the expedition, Troy Baker loved this land.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
                   &lt;p&gt;Troy Baker is ambivalent about the other men in his crew. “I did not care. Instinctively, deftly, brutishly, I harnessed ten of them to my sledge; put on Canadian snow shoes; and was away northward--alone”*. The other men hated Troy Baker and Troy Baker thought that was fine. It was not surprising nor completely unpleasant news to others aboard the Canadian Research Submarine, that Troy Baker disappeared, but absence in any form is inherently doleful. &lt;/p&gt;        

        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;Death is a transfer of energy. Troy Baker is not a collector.&lt;/q&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Do all Homio Sapiens envy the experience of true suffering? Troy Baker is the third and last child of Bob and Tina Baker. Troy Baker left his men, his job, and his ship because he is not a collector. He is here in this Loveland, where it is not tropical and vibrant and fruitful. Troy Baker is alone with his sister, alone with &lt;em&gt;The Purple Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, alone in the dark with an ultraviolet emerald. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;A Field Guide to Marcel Dzama's 'A Game of Chess'&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By Bill Brown&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The following is the first edition of a compilation of themes found in Marcel Dzama’s film, &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt;. The fourteen minute video depicts a game of chess brought to life through ballet. The full video is shown below and then the encyclopedia itself immediately thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/35884866?badge=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Person with Multiple Faces&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A person with multiple faces is an individual who has more than one complete set of sensory organs (sight, smell and taste) on the same head. Usually male, this person is often depicted as a god, villain or fantastical being of ambiguous morality. Each face sometimes represents a different personality of the same individual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
                &lt;p&gt;In Dzama’s &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt;, there is a tall, black caped figure wearing a four faced mask. This character is the Black King, but is never actually seen playing on the board. As the leader of the black chess pieces, this character perpetually wants to annihilate the players on the white side.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Janus&lt;/b&gt;, the roman god of beginnings and transitions. He has one face looking toward the future and one toward the past.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Man-E-Faces&lt;/b&gt;, villain from the cartoon &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt;. He has three faces including a human, a monster and a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brahma&lt;/b&gt;, the four faced Hindu god of creation. Each head continually recites scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mayor of Halloween Town&lt;/b&gt; from the movie &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;. He has one frowning face and one smiling face.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Chess Pieces Brought to Life&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Chess pieces brought to life are moving animate beings, no longer dependent on players to be physically moved. While the pieces seem to have the ability to think for themselves they still act within the rules of the game. When players come in contact with each other they will literally kill or destroy their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt; the pieces exist in a pseudo-alternate world. The rules of the game are abstractly followed, resulting in a stylized form of war. However when pieces come in contact with each other, the player’s violent deaths portray a real and unforgiving world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Human Chess Game from &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Life sized chess pieces are enchanted and and brought to life to guard the philosopher’s stone.&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Battle Chess&lt;/b&gt;, a chess based computer game first released in 1988. The game is played with the standard rules of chess but each time a piece is taken an animated battle scene occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holochess&lt;/b&gt;, a chess game that uses animated, holographic representations of exotic aliens as the chess pieces. Holochess is played in the film series &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final battle between Alice and the Queen of Hearts in Tim Burton’s &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; includes marching white chess pieces among the participants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

                &lt;h2&gt;Full Body Polka Dot Spandex&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Full body polka dot spandex is a skin tight suit covered in dots. The suit completely covers the individual from head to toe including the individual’s face.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt; the pawns all wear full body polka dot spandex suits, one side in black suits with white dots and the other in white suits with black dots. The pawns all move in unison and are reminiscent of synchronized swimmers wearing swim caps.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clowns&lt;/b&gt;, comedic performers who sometimes wear red and yellow polka dot suits.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Spot&lt;/b&gt;, a comic book supervillain often paired against Spider-Man or Daredevil.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Zentai suit&lt;/b&gt;, a full body unmarked spandex suit popularized by Green Man in &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; and two hockey loving fans of the Vancouver Canucks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yayoi Kusama&lt;/b&gt;, a Japanese artist and writer known for her use of polka dots.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;        
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Dance Fighting&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dance Fighting is the combination of moving the body in a rhythmic way usually to music with acts of aggression resulting in physical harm. In both dance and close combat fighting, the participants must read and react to the movements of the other performers.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                &lt;p&gt;In Marcel Dzama’s &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt; the chess game is brought to life as a ballet. The pieces dance on the board and kill each other whenever a piece is captured. Like in other performative spectacles an audience watches the progression of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capoeira&lt;/b&gt;, a brazilian martial art that combines dance and music. Sometimes referred to as “Break Dance Fighting,” this style was popularized by Eddy Gordo, a character from the video game &lt;em&gt;Tekken&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dance Dance Revolution&lt;/b&gt;, an arcade game where players compete in a virtual “dance-off” on platforms and press big buttons with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Nutcracker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, a ballet where nutcracker’s come to life and battle rats.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moshing&lt;/b&gt;, a style of dance where people push and shove into each other.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Female snipers are markswomen skilled at shooting with great accuracy from long distances. The vast majority of snipers are male.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                &lt;p&gt;In Marcel Dzama’s &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt; the main character, if there is one, would be the sniper and central pawn, both played by the same actress. As the sniper she shoots the chess player using the white pieces from a bedroom window. Respectively, as a black pawn she kills white pieces in the chess world.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h2&gt;Masked Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A masked audience is a group of people watching a performance whose faces are hidden or obscured. Through being masked the audience is transformed into participants. The masks are usually identical.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                &lt;p&gt;In Dzama’s &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt; the audience is seen wearing round, smiling, cherub-like masks throughout the film. They are very dramatic in their reactions to the chess game, sometimes ringing cowbells and shakers in their enthusiasm. The last scene of the film shows the masks being lifted from the audience only to reveal individuals completely covered in white sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;        
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characters in the film &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wear masks while watching unmasked entertainers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep No More&lt;/b&gt;, a site-specific play by theatre company Punchdrunk. Audience members are instructed to remain silent and masked at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guy Fawkes mask&lt;/b&gt;, a mask often worn at protests for anonymity popularized from the film, V for Vendetta.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Masquerade balls&lt;/b&gt;, events where the participants attend in costume wearing a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Thus concludes the first edition of Marcel Dzama’s &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt; encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h1&gt;Shining Under the Bridge&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;A completely fictional interview with the artists behind the North Street soundwave project&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By Bill Brown&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;waiver&quot;&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;WAIVER: The interview and article that follows is not real.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last Friday I had the honor of speaking with Carolyn, Darya, Perry and Dana, the artists behind the North Street soundwave mural. The giant soundwave bolting out from under the “bike-pathed” bridge just outside downtown Northampton is partially funded by the Northampton Arts Council and the Ward 3 Neighborhood Association. I met up with the four identical quadruplets while riding my tricycle through the hallways of the historic Northampton Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;middle-full-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Context: First off, I love the mural. Can you talk a little bit about how the project came about?&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Carolyn: Well, all four of us are part of an artist collective called C3, which was approached by the Ward 3 City Councilor, Owen Freeman Daniels, to paint the mural. He gave us complete control and responsibility over the project, from concept to execution, which was both a blessing and a curse. The later being something we are rather familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Darya: The mural itself is the visualization of a 24 hour long recording we took with an iphone in the same spot where the mural was painted. We noticed that the wall was surrounded by street, sidewalk, bike path, blood elevator and railway and we thought the combined sounds throughout the day would be unique.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;Well, you know, when something happens, it can leave a trace of itself behind.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-6.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-7.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Context: Can you say a little more about the concept and your choice to depict a soundwave?&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Darya: Well, you know, when something happens, it can leave a trace of itself behind. Say like, if someone burns toast. Well, maybe things happen and leave other kinds of traces behind. Not things that anyone can notice, but things that certain people can see. Even things that might have happened a long time ago. I think a lot of things happened right here under this particular bridge over the years. And not all of them were good.&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Perry: The soundwave was one way to capture that trace left behind. A snapshot of one day in 2012...the commuters, the strollers, the bikers, all the people that interacted with that space during the day are represented as a blip in the soundwave. I like to think of it as a hyper-local piece of public art. Something made for and representative of the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Dana: I gave a lot of thought to the surrounding neighborhood as well. One side of the bridge is mainly residential houses while the other is full of commercial buildings. Going under the bridge is kind of like traveling through a gateway between living and work space. The soundwave sits at the intersection of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;full-middle-image image-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;section class=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-8.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-9.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-10.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Context: Yea, finding a balance between work and play is important. All work and no play can make things quite dull. On a different subject, is it difficult working with family? Especially as identical quadruplets?&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Carolyn: Oh gosh, no. We’ve been working together now for at least 200 years, so we’ve figured out most of the kinks. We did come to a bit of a disagreement about the color scheme...&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Perry: OK, OK. Look, the grey and the orange work as backdrops to the soundwave because those are colors we see in the immediate area...like the grey asphalt of the street and the orange street signs under the bridge. The vibrant teal of the soundwave itself is a color we don’t see, just like we don’t normally “see” sound. Anyway, I'm sure people don't want to listen to us argue.&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Context: No, no, no, no - that is MY responsibility as a journalist and interviewer. Have any of you ever had a SINGLE MOMENT'S THOUGHT about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought, for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to WRITE an ARTICLE about the sound wave mural? Do you have the SLIGHTEST IDEA, what a MORAL AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLE IS, DO YOU? Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities? Has it ever occurred to you? HAS IT?&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Carolyn: Wh-what?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;Come play with us! Come play with us forever!&lt;/q&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Context: Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what came over me...I noticed the numbers at the top of the mural - do those refer to the time of day?&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Darya: Yes, exactly. We decided to start the mural at 7pm so that the quietest part of the day would be at the center of the soundwave. At most times during the day the noises become pretty repetitive with cars constantly coming and going. Between 1 and 5 am those cars stop and we are left to speculate on what are causing the remaining sounds. Its fun to look at the blips during that time and wonder if it was an animal, a late night wanderer or something...different...&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Context: I can only imagine. Lastly, there are a lot of murals and bridge art throughout northampton but this one seems to stand out. Why do you think that is?&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Carolyn: From an aesthetic standpoint I think the limited color pallet and strong bold colors makes it look a little different. But I think its concept is what really makes it stand out. Public art that represents a community is traditionally seen as a wall of people and faces. But this mural does it in a very different way. The soundwave is a unique product of the local community made by the community - in a way all we've done is document an audio phenomena by presenting it visually as a mural.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Dana: One of our favorite parts of this project was meeting and interacting with the community near the mural. We found ourselves chanting &quot;Come play with us!&quot; because we loved it so much. We could play with them forever.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Perry: Yea, forever...&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Darya: forever...&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h1&gt;Animism and Information Translation&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;A Review of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot's Solo Show at the University Museum of Contemporary Art&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By Jessie Vogel&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For my first visit to UMass Amherst’s Museum of Contemporary Art, I viewed the exhibition of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot, a Paris based artist, who marries sound and sculpture into an emotional environment. The material and its auditory capabilities feel as though they are acting alone, without any human direction. The somber and dense architecture of UMCA was an appropriate aesthetic environment. It’s immense concrete walls felt like an absorbing void after an apocalypse, emphasizing the objects and mechanisms left behind. Despite the apparent lack of human imposition, each work was displayed with precision and tasteful sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;middle-full-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My initial reaction to the room was an eerie sense of calm, as though setting the stage to be hypnotized. This feeling came from the quiet and dimly lit projections that pulsated and transformed throughout the space. These glowing abstract orbs, titled &lt;em&gt;viruses&lt;/em&gt;, and accompanying silk screened images taken from stills of the projection, established the mood. The row of monochromatic silkscreens are made up of layers of ink that slowly reveal the &lt;em&gt;virus&lt;/em&gt; image. Bringing the pulsating &lt;em&gt;virus&lt;/em&gt; into a low tech translation, a series of 2D prints, embodies the notion that an idea can be expressed through many different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;An oddly beautiful object in its simplicity and function ...&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-3.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-4.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After the initiation into the room with &lt;em&gt;viruses&lt;/em&gt;, I was immediately drawn to the quiet teleprompter in the back. An oddly beautiful object in its simplicity and function, transports information revealing seemingly random numbers and letters on it’s screen. As you investigate further, you realize that the text is stock market data being fed via the internet that is then processed through software that transforms the text into a musical score. This score is then heard through a self playing piano in the next room. I found the separation of the two counterparts, the teleprompter and the piano, to be an interesting installation choice, for I did not make the connection immediately. Together they are titled &lt;em&gt;indexes&lt;/em&gt;. This disconnect is a recurring installation theme throughout the exhibit. The origin of the information/sound is directly made from what is visual, but the context has been shifted slightly and therefore both revealed and hidden at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;full-middle-image image-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;section class=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-couch.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-flame.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;zombiedrone&lt;/em&gt;, an installation made up of a plasma screen tv, a black leather couch and a remote control, caught my eye next. The tv played a dark and distorted movie which gave off a sinister vibe when combined with the black masculine couch. It would not be a stretch for ones imagination to trick you into thinking you were viewing a scene from &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. As I started to decipher the image I noticed it was more benign. In fact, the tv was broadcasting everyday television programing. &lt;em&gt;zombiedrone&lt;/em&gt; uses the scenario of processing information through a predetermined set of rules. Here the unmoving images are blacked out. The viewer also has the ability to change the channel at will and try to make sense of the partially hidden screen. Unlike &lt;em&gt;indexes&lt;/em&gt;, I felt that this was overtly trying to be macabre instead of a quite investigation of material. The dramatic masculine materials led me to dramatic and masculine notions. Having the viewer be an active translator made this installation successful in its subtlety.  &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On the more quiet end of the exhibit we see, &lt;em&gt;flameByframe&lt;/em&gt;, a somewhat hidden ghostly apparition. It is only really noticeable after viewing &lt;em&gt;zombidrome&lt;/em&gt; or when you turn to leave. The projection is a video of a blowtorch flame in slow motion. As the video camera was filming, it was taking the image and translating that information into audio. The audio was played through a subwoofer that altered the movement of the flame. This created a circle of image information effecting sound information and vise versa, until the flame eventually blows itself out. In the final display, Celeste only shows the video of the flame slowly dancing in complete silence. Beautiful by itself, the knowledge of the chaotic scenario that produced &lt;em&gt;flameByframe&lt;/em&gt; was not directly apparent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;One thing leading to the next and the next and the next until even the links become irrelevant.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The written information is part of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot work but I appreciate its discreteness in not being a visual aspect of the show. This is an exhibition to be absorbed and experienced. There doesn't seem to be a direct meaning except what the material is and what it can sound like. Information shown, information dissolved and information transformed. One thing leading to the next and the next and the next until even the links become irrelevant. The link becomes less important as the idea of animism became more important. What you see and what you hear and how that translates to you is entirely subjective but the objects themselves are neutral in terms of the laws imposed on them by Celeste Boursier-Mougenot. They do what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
