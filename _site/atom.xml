            &lt;h2&gt;A Field Guide to Marcel Dzama's 'A Game of Chess'&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By Bill Brown&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The following is the first edition of the unreviewed and incomplete compilation of Marcel Dzama’s film, &lt;em&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/em&gt;. The fourteen minute video depicts a game of chess brought to life through ballet. The full video is shown below and then the directory itself immediately thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/35884866?badge=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Person with Multiple Faces&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A person with multiple faces&lt;/strong&gt; is an individual who has more than one face on the same head.  Usually male, this person is often depicted as a god, villain or fantastical being of ambiguous morality. Each face  sometimes represents a different personality of the same individual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
                &lt;p&gt;In Dzama’s &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt; there is a tall, black caped figure wearing a four faced mask. This character  is the Black King, but is never actually seen playing on the board. As the leader of the black side, Dzama’s quad-face is perpetually wanting to annihilate pieces on the white side.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Janus&lt;/b&gt;, the roman god of beginnings and translations. He has one face looking toward the future and one toward the past.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Man-E-Faces&lt;/b&gt;, villain from the cartoon Masters of the Universe. He has three faces including a human, a monster and a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brahma&lt;/b&gt;, the four faced Hindu god of creation. Each head continually recites scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/multi-face_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mayor of Halloween Town&lt;/b&gt; from the movie &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;. He has one frowning face and one smiling face.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Chess Pieces Brought to Life&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chess pieces brought to life&lt;/b&gt; occurs when normal chess pieces exist as moving animate beings, no longer pieces to be physically moved by the players. While the pieces seem to have the ability to think for themselves they still act within the rules of the game. When pieces come in contact with each other they will literally kill or destroy their opponents. Life-sized chess pieces brought to life is not to be confused with people playing chess with people dressed up as chess pieces, which usually happens as a display of wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
        
                &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt; the pieces exist in a psudo-alternate world. The sniper is the only character that can pass through between environments and is the only unmasked human figure in the chess world. The rules of the game are loosely followed but when pieces come in contact with each other players are literally stabbed, resulting in blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Human Chess Game from &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Life sized chess pieces are enchanted and and brought to life to guard the philosopher’s stone.&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Battle Chess&lt;/b&gt;, a video game version of chess in which the chess pieces come to life and battle one another when capturing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holochess&lt;/b&gt;, a chess game from the movie &lt;i&gt;Starwars&lt;/i&gt; that uses holographic representations of exotic aliens as the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/life-sized_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final battle in Tim Burton’s &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; shows marching black and white chess pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;        
                &lt;h2&gt;Full Body Polkadot Spandex&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Full body Polkadot spandex&lt;/b&gt; is a skin tight suit covered in dots. The suit completely covers the individual from head to toe including the individual’s face.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt; the pawns all wear full body Polkadot spandex suits, one side with black suits and white dots and the other in the reverse. The pawns all move in unison and are reminiscent of synchronized swimmers wearing swim caps. The eyes of the suits are cut out and the head are all slightly elongated, perhaps because of the dancer’s hair pulled back into buns.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clowns&lt;/b&gt; often wear a red and yellow polka dot suit which only covers the body.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/polka_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50s/60s polka dot dresses&lt;/b&gt; worn by Lucy in the show I love Lucy and Minnie Mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;        
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Dance Fighting&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dance Fighting&lt;/b&gt; is the combination of dance and fighting. Usually dance is used as a metaphor for close combat in a ballet or musical but sometimes dancing is part of a real combatants fighting style. In both dance and close combat the contestants must read and react to their partner’s moves.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                &lt;p&gt;In Marcel Dzama’s &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt; the chess game is brought to life as a dance performance, particularly ballet. An audience watches on as the pieces dance on the board and fight and kill each other as the game progresses. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capoeira&lt;/b&gt;, a brazilian martial art that combines dance and music. Sometimes referred to as “Break Dance Fighting” this style was popularized by Eddy Gordo, a character from the video game Tekken.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dance Dance Revolution&lt;/b&gt;, an arcade game where players compete on platforms and press big buttons with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Nutcracker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, a ballet where nutcracker’s come to life and battle rats.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/dance-fight_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moshing&lt;/b&gt;, a style of dance where people push and shove into each other.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/sniper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;        
                &lt;h2&gt;Female Snipers&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female snipers&lt;/b&gt; are markswomen skilled at shooting with great accuracy from long distances. The fast majority of military snipers are male.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                &lt;p&gt;In Marcel Dzama’s &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt; the main character, if there is one, would be the sniper and main pawn, both played by the same actress. This character kills the white pieces on the chess board and literally shoots and kills the chess player for the white side in the “real world.” &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/sniper_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyudmila Pavlichenko&lt;/b&gt;, a soviet sniper during World War II. With 309 kills, she is regarded as the most successful female sniper in history.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/sniper_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annie Oakley&lt;/b&gt;, an American sharpshooter and exhibition shooter. Oakley's amazing talent and timely rise to fame led to a starring role in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/sniper_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mathilda&lt;/b&gt;, an apprentice hitwoman played by Natalie Portman in the movie &lt;i&gt;Leon: The Professional&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                 &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/sniper_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katniss Everdeen&lt;/b&gt;, a hunter from the book turned movie series “Hunger Games.”&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;        
                &lt;h2&gt;Masked Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A masked audience is an audience whose faces are hidden and anonymoused. The audience then becomes a part of the performance or entertainment that they are watching. The masks are usually identical or very similar when the individual audience members are not characters in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                &lt;p&gt;In Dzama’s &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt; the audience is seen wearing round, smiling, cherub-like masks throughout the film. They are very dramatic in their reactions to the chess game, sometimes ringing cowbells and shakers in their enthusiasm. The last scene of the film shows the masks being lifted from the audience only to reveal individuals completely covered in white sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;across-4&quot;&gt;        
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the film &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eyes Wide Shot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, people are seen at a party all wearing masks watching unmasked entertainers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Statler and Waldorf&lt;/b&gt;,  a pair of Muppet characters who heckle the rest of the cast from their balcony seats.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mystery Science Theater&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, a tv series that features a man and his robot sidekicks who provide a running commentary on B-list sci-fi movies.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/chess/audience_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;multi-face&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep No More&lt;/b&gt;, a site-specific play by theatre company Punchdrunk. Audience members are instructed to remain silent and masked at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Thus concludes the 1st addition encyclopedia of Marcel Dzama’s &lt;i&gt;A Game of Chess&lt;/i&gt;. Future addendums will be included in the 2nd addition to come out in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Last Friday I had the honor of speaking with Carolyn, Darya, Perry and Dana, the artists behind the North Street Soundwave mural. The giant soundwave bolting out from under the “bike-pathed” bridge just outside downtown Northampton. The mural was partially funded by the Northampton Arts Council and the Ward 3 Neighborhood Association. I met up with the four identical quadruplets while riding my tricycle through the hallways of the historic Northampton Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;middle-full-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; “First off, I love the mural. Can you talk a little bit about how the project came about?”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn:&lt;/b&gt; “Well, all four of us are part of an artist collective called C3, which was approached by the Ward 3 City Councilor, Owen Freeman Daniels, to paint the mural. He gave us complete control and responsibility over the project, from concept to execution, which was both a blessing and a curse. The later being something we are rather familiar with.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darya:&lt;/b&gt; “The mural itself is the visualization of a 24 hour long recording we took with an iphone in the same spot where the mural was painted. We noticed that the wall was surrounded by street, sidewalk, bike path, blood elevator and railway and we thought the combined sounds throughout the day would be unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;Well, you know, when something happens, it can leave a trace of itself behind.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-6.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-7.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; “Can you say a little more about the concept and your choice to depict a soundwave?”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darya:&lt;/b&gt; “Well, you know, when something happens, it can leave a trace of itself behind. Say like, if someone burns toast. Well, maybe things happen and leave other kinds of traces behind. Not things that anyone can notice, but things that certain people can see. Even things that might have happened a long time ago. I think a lot of things happened right here under this particular bridge over the years. And not all of them were good.”&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perry:&lt;/b&gt; “The soundwave was one way to capture that trace left behind. A snapshot of one day in 2012, the commuters, the strollers, the bikers, all the people and things that interacted with that space during the day are represented as a blip in the 	soundwave. I like to think of it as a hyper-local piece of public art. Something made for and representative of the surrounding area.”&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dana:&lt;/b&gt; “I gave a lot of thought to the surrounding neighborhood as well. One side of the bridge is mainly residential houses while the other is full of commercial buildings. Going under the bridge is kind of like traveling through a gateway between living and work space. The soundwave sits at the intersection of the two.”&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;full-middle-image image-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-9.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/mural-10.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; “Yea, finding a balance between work and play is important. All work and no play can make things quite dull. On a different subject, is it difficult working with family? Especially as identical quadruplets?”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn:&lt;/b&gt; “Oh gosh, no. We’ve been working together now for at least 200 years, so we’ve worked out most of the kinks. We did come to a bit of a disagreement about the color scheme...”&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perry:&lt;/b&gt; “OK, OK. Look, the grey and the orange work as backdrops to the soundwave because those are colors we see in the immediate area...like the grey asphalt of the street and the orange street signs under the bridge. The vibrant teal of the soundwave itself is a color we don’t see, just like we don’t normally “see” sound. Anyway, I'm sure people don't want to listen to us argue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; “No, no, no, no - that is MY responsibility as a journalist and interviewer. Have any of you ever had a SINGLE MOMENT'S THOUGHT about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought, for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to WRITE an ARTICLE about the sound wave mural? Do you have the SLIGHTEST IDEA, what a MORAL AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLE IS, DO YOU? Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities? Has it ever occurred to you? HAS IT?&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Carolyn:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Wh-what?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;Come play with us! Come play with us forever!&lt;/q&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what came over me...I noticed the numbers at the top of the mural - do those refer to the time of day?”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darya:&lt;/b&gt; “Yes, Exactly. We decided to start the mural at 7pm so that the quietest part of the day would be at the center of the soundwave. At most times during the day the noises become pretty repetitive with cars constantly coming and going. But between 1 and 5 am those cars stop and the sounds that remain we can only speculate on. Its fun to look at the blips during that time and wonder if it was an animal, a late night wanderer or something...different...”&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; “I can only imagine. Lastly, there are a lot of murals and bridge art throughout northampton but this one seems to stand out. Why do you think that is?&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn:&lt;/b&gt; “From an aesthetic standpoint I think the limited color pallet and strong bold colors makes it look a little different. But I think its concept is really what makes it stand out. Traditionally when you think of public art representative of a community you see a wall of people and faces. But this mural does it in a very different way. The soundwave is a direct marking of the local community made by the community - in a way all we've done is document that and presented it visually as a mural.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dana:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;One of our favorite parts of this project was meeting and interacting with the community near the mural. We found ourselves wanting to chant &quot;Come play with us!&quot; because we loved it so much. We could play with them forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perry:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Yea, forever...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darya:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;forever...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;A Review of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot's Solo Show at the University Museum of Contemporary Art&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By Jessie Vogel&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For my first visit to UMass Amherst’s Museum of Contemporary Art, I viewed the exhibition of Celeste Boursier-Mougenot. A Paris based artist who marries sound and sculpture into an emotional environment. The material and its auditory capabilities feel as though they are acting alone, without any human direction. The somber and dense architecture of UMCA was an appropriate aesthetic environment. It’s immense concrete walls felt like an absorbing void after an apocalypse, emphasising the objects and mechanisms left behind. Despite the apparent lack of human imposition, each work was displayed with precision and tasteful sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;middle-full-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My initial reaction to the room was an eerie sense of calm, as though setting the stage to be hypnotized. This feeling came from the quiet and dimly lit projections that pulsated and transformed throughout the space. These glowing abstract orbs, titled &lt;em&gt;viruses&lt;/em&gt;, and accompanying silk screened images taken from stills of the projection, established the mood. The row of monochromatic silkscreens are made up of layers of ink that slowly reveal the &lt;em&gt;virus&lt;/em&gt; image. Bringing the pulsating &lt;em&gt;virus&lt;/em&gt; into a low tech translation, a series of 2D prints, embodies the notion that an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; can be expressed through many different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;An oddly beautiful object in its simplicity and function to transport information.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-3.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-4.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After the initiation into the room with &lt;em&gt;viruses&lt;/em&gt;, I was immediately drawn to the quiet teleprompter in the back. An oddly beautiful object   in its simplicity and function to transport information. Revealing seemingly random numbers and letters on it’s screen. As you investigate further,   you realize that the text is stock market data being fed via the internet that is then processed through software that transforms the text into a     musical score. This score is then heard through a self playing piano in the next room. I found the separation of the two counterparts, the  teleprompter and the Piano (&lt;em&gt;indexes&lt;/em&gt;), to be an interesting installation choice, for I did not make the connection immediately. This     disconnect is a recurring installation theme throughout the exhibit. The origin of the information/sound is directly made from what is visual, but  the context has been shifted slightly and therefore both revealed and hidden at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;full-middle-image image-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;section class=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-left-image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-couch.jpg&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../img/celeste-flame.jpg&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;column-right&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zombiedrone&lt;/em&gt;, an installation made up of a plasma screen tv, a black leather couch and a remote control, caught my eye next. The tv played a dark and distorted movie which gave off a very sinister vibe when combined with the black masculine couch. I am a science fiction fan and I immediately went to thinking I was watching Alien. As I started to decipher what I was looking at, it turned out to be a kids movie. The movie did have a cartoon alien character but it was not quite the 1979 “Alien” I had in mind. &lt;em&gt;Zombiedrone&lt;/em&gt; uses the same scenario of processing information through a predetermined set of rules. Here the unmoving images are blacked out. The viewer also has the ability to change the channel at will and try to make sense of the partially hidden screen. Unlike &lt;em&gt;indexes&lt;/em&gt;, I felt that this was overtly trying to be mccabe instead of a quite investigation of material. The dramatic masculine materials lead me to dramatic and masculine notions, but the viewer as active translator was successful in its subtlety.  &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On the more quiet end of the exhibit we see,  &lt;em&gt;flameByframe&lt;/em&gt;, a somewhat hidden ghostly apparition. Only really noticeable after viewing Zombidrome or when you turn to leave. It is a video of a blow torch flame in slow motion. As the video camera was filming, it was taking the image and translating that information into audio. The audio was played through a subwoofer that altered the movement of the flame. This created a circle, of image information effecting sound information and vise versa, until the flame eventually blows itself out. In the final display, Celeste only shows us a video the flame, slowly dancing in complete silence. Beautiful by itself, the knowledge of the chaotic scenario that produced  &lt;em&gt;flameByframe&lt;/em&gt; was not directly apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;q class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;One thing leading to the next and the next and the next until even the links become irrelevant.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The textual information is part of the work but I appreciate its discreteness. This is an exhibition to be absorbed and experienced. There doesn't seem to be a direct meaning except what the material is and what it can sound like. Information shown, information dissolved and information transformed. One thing leading to the next and the next and the next until even the links become irrelevant. The link becomes less important as the idea of animism became more important. What you see and what you hear and how that translates to you is entirely subjective but the objects themselves are neutral in terms of the laws imposed on them by Celeste Boursier-Mougenot. They do what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
