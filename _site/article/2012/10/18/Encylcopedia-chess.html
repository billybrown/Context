            <h2>A Field Guide to Marcel Dzama's 'A Game of Chess'</h2>
            <p>By Bill Brown</p>
        </hgroup>
        <p>The following is the first edition of a compilation of themes found in Marcel Dzama’s film, <em>A Game of Chess</em>. The fourteen minute video depicts a game of chess brought to life through ballet. The full video is shown below and then the encyclopedia itself immediately thereafter.</p>

                <h2>Person with Multiple Faces</h2>
                <p>A person with multiple faces is an individual who has more than one complete set of sensory organs (sight, smell and taste) on the same head. Usually male, this person is often depicted as a god, villain or fantastical being of ambiguous morality. Each face sometimes represents a different personality of the same individual.</p>
    
                <p>In Dzama’s <em>A Game of Chess</em>, there is a tall, black caped figure wearing a four faced mask. This character is the Black King, but is never actually seen playing on the board. As the leader of the black chess pieces, this character perpetually wants to annihilate the players on the white side.</p>

                <h2>Chess Pieces Brought to Life</h2>
                <p>Chess pieces brought to life are moving animate beings, no longer dependent on players to be physically moved. While the pieces seem to have the ability to think for themselves they still act within the rules of the game. When players come in contact with each other they will literally kill or destroy their opponents.</p>
        
                <p>In <em>A Game of Chess</em> the pieces exist in a pseudo-alternate world. The rules of the game are abstractly followed, resulting in a stylized form of war. However when pieces come in contact with each other, the player’s violent deaths portray a real and unforgiving world.</p>

                <p>Full body polka dot spandex is a skin tight suit covered in dots. The suit completely covers the individual from head to toe including the individual’s face.</p>
        
                <p>In <em>A Game of Chess</em> the pawns all wear full body polka dot spandex suits, one side in black suits with white dots and the other in white suits with black dots. The pawns all move in unison and are reminiscent of synchronized swimmers wearing swim caps.</p>

                <h2>Dance Fighting</h2>
                <p>Dance Fighting is the combination of moving the body in a rhythmic way usually to music with acts of aggression resulting in physical harm. In both dance and close combat fighting, the participants must read and react to the movements of the other performers.</p>
                
                <p>In Marcel Dzama’s <em>A Game of Chess</em> the chess game is brought to life as a ballet. The pieces dance on the board and kill each other whenever a piece is captured. Like in other performative spectacles an audience watches the progression of the game.</p>

                <h2>Female Snipers</h2>
                <p>Female snipers are markswomen skilled at shooting with great accuracy from long distances. The vast majority of snipers are male.</p>
                
                <p>In Marcel Dzama’s <em>A Game of Chess</em> the main character, if there is one, would be the sniper and central pawn, both played by the same actress. As the sniper she shoots the chess player using the white pieces from a bedroom window. Respectively, as a black pawn she kills white pieces in the chess world.</p>

                <h2>Masked Audience</h2>
                <p>A masked audience is a group of people watching a performance whose faces are hidden or obscured. Through being masked the audience is transformed into participants. The masks are usually identical.</p>
        
                <p>In Dzama’s <em>A Game of Chess</em> the audience is seen wearing round, smiling, cherub-like masks throughout the film. They are very dramatic in their reactions to the chess game, sometimes ringing cowbells and shakers in their enthusiasm. The last scene of the film shows the masks being lifted from the audience only to reveal individuals completely covered in white sheets.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <ul class="across-4">        
            <li><img src="../../../../img/chess/audience_1.jpg" alt="multi-face"/>
                <p><b>Characters in the film <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em></b> wear masks while watching unmasked entertainers.</p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="../../../../img/chess/audience_4.jpg" alt="multi-face"/>
                <p><b>Sleep No More</b>, a site-specific play by theatre company Punchdrunk. Audience members are instructed to remain silent and masked at all times.</p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="../../../../img/chess/audience_6.jpg" alt="multi-face"/>
                <p><b>Guy Fawkes mask</b>, a mask often worn at protests for anonymity popularized from the film, V for Vendetta.</p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="../../../../img/chess/audience_5.jpg" alt="multi-face"/>
                <p><b>Masquerade balls</b>, events where the participants attend in costume wearing a mask. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>Thus concludes the first edition of Marcel Dzama’s <em>A Game of Chess</em> encyclopedia.</p>
