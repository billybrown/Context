            <h1>Shining Under the Bridge</h1>
            <h2>A completely fictional interview with the artists behind The North Street Soundwave Project</h2>
            <p>By Bill Brown</p>
        </hgroup>
        <div class="waiver">
        	<p>WAIVER: The interview and article that follows is not real.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Last Friday I had the honor of speaking with Carolyn, Darya, Perry and Dana, the artists behind the North Street Soundwave mural. The giant soundwave bolting out from under the “bike-pathed” bridge just outside downtown Northampton. The mural was partially funded by the Northampton Arts Council and the Ward 3 Neighborhood Association. I met up with the four identical quadruplets while riding my tricycle through the hallways of the historic Northampton Hotel.</p>
        <div class="middle-full-image"><img src="../../../../img/mural-1.jpg"/></div>
        <p><b>Me:</b> “First off, I love the mural. Can you talk a little bit about how the project came about?”</p>

		<p><b>Carolyn:</b> “Well, all four of us are part of an artist collective called C3, which was approached by the Ward 3 City Councilor, Owen Freeman Daniels, to paint the mural. He gave us complete control and responsibility over the project, from concept to execution, which was both a blessing and a curse. The later being something we are rather familiar with.”</p>

		<p><b>Darya:</b> “The mural itself is the visualization of a 24 hour long recording we took with an iphone in the same spot where the mural was painted. We noticed that the wall was surrounded by street, sidewalk, bike path, blood elevator and railway and we thought the combined sounds throughout the day would be unique.”</p>
        <q class="pull-quote">Well, you know, when something happens, it can leave a trace of itself behind.</q>

                <img src="../../../../img/mural-6.jpg"/>
                <img src="../../../../img/mural-7.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <div class="column-left">
                <p><b>Me:</b> “Can you say a little more about the concept and your choice to depict a soundwave?”</p>

				<p><b>Darya:</b> “Well, you know, when something happens, it can leave a trace of itself behind. Say like, if someone burns toast. Well, maybe things happen and leave other kinds of traces behind. Not things that anyone can notice, but things that certain people can see. Even things that might have happened a long time ago. I think a lot of things happened right here under this particular bridge over the years. And not all of them were good.”</p>
				
				<p><b>Perry:</b> “The soundwave was one way to capture that trace left behind. A snapshot of one day in 2012, the commuters, the strollers, the bikers, all the people and things that interacted with that space during the day are represented as a blip in the 	soundwave. I like to think of it as a hyper-local piece of public art. Something made for and representative of the surrounding area.”</p>
				
				<p><b>Dana:</b> “I gave a lot of thought to the surrounding neighborhood as well. One side of the bridge is mainly residential houses while the other is full of commercial buildings. Going under the bridge is kind of like traveling through a gateway between living and work space. The soundwave sits at the intersection of the two.”</p>

                <p><b>Me:</b> “Yea, finding a balance between work and play is important. All work and no play can make things quite dull. On a different subject, is it difficult working with family? Especially as identical quadruplets?”</p>

				<p><b>Carolyn:</b> “Oh gosh, no. We’ve been working together now for at least 200 years, so we’ve worked out most of the kinks. We did come to a bit of a disagreement about the color scheme...”</p>
				
				<p><b>Perry:</b> “OK, OK. Look, the grey and the orange work as backdrops to the soundwave because those are colors we see in the immediate area...like the grey asphalt of the street and the orange street signs under the bridge. The vibrant teal of the soundwave itself is a color we don’t see, just like we don’t normally “see” sound. Anyway, I'm sure people don't want to listen to us argue."</p>
				
				<p><b>Me:</b> “No, no, no, no - that is MY responsibility as a journalist and interviewer. Have any of you ever had a SINGLE MOMENT'S THOUGHT about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought, for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to WRITE an ARTICLE about the sound wave mural? Do you have the SLIGHTEST IDEA, what a MORAL AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLE IS, DO YOU? Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities? Has it ever occurred to you? HAS IT?</p>
				
				<p>Carolyn:</b> "Wh-what?"</p>
            </div>

        <q class="pull-quote">Come play with us! Come play with us forever!</q>

        <p><b>Me:</b> "Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what came over me...I noticed the numbers at the top of the mural - do those refer to the time of day?”</p>

		<p><b>Darya:</b> “Yes, Exactly. We decided to start the mural at 7pm so that the quietest part of the day would be at the center of the soundwave. At most times during the day the noises become pretty repetitive with cars constantly coming and going. But between 1 and 5 am those cars stop and the sounds that remain we can only speculate on. Its fun to look at the blips during that time and wonder if it was an animal, a late night wanderer or something...different...”</p>
		
		<p><b>Me:</b> “I can only imagine. Lastly, there are a lot of murals and bridge art throughout northampton but this one seems to stand out. Why do you think that is?</p>
		
		<p><b>Carolyn:</b> “From an aesthetic standpoint I think the limited color pallet and strong bold colors makes it look a little different. But I think its concept is really what makes it stand out. Traditionally when you think of public art representative of a community you see a wall of people and faces. But this mural does it in a very different way. The soundwave is a direct marking of the local community made by the community - in a way all we've done is document that and presented it visually as a mural."</p>
		
		<p><b>Dana:</b> "One of our favorite parts of this project was meeting and interacting with the community near the mural. We found ourselves wanting to chant "Come play with us!" because we loved it so much. We could play with them forever."</p>
		
		<p><b>Perry:</b> "Yea, forever..."</p>
		
		<p><b>Darya:</b> "forever..."</p>
